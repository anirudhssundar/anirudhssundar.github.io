I'm an ECE PhD student at [Georgia Tech](https://www.ece.gatech.edu/) in the AI Virtual Assitant (AVA) Lab advised by [Professor Larry Heck](https://www.ece.gatech.edu/faculty-staff-directory/larry-p-heck). I'm interested in multimodal machine learning for conversational AI. My research goals include the development of Broad Intelligence in AI. I'm also passionate about Reinforcement Learning.  

I completed my undergraduate degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering at [National Institute of Technology - Karnataka, India.](https://www.nitk.ac.in/)
