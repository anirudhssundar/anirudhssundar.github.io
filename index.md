Hi I'm an incoming PhD student at Georgia Tech. I'm interested in signal processing, machine learning and pattern recognition. 

I completed my undergraduate degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering at [National Institute of Technology - Karnataka, India.](https://www.nitk.ac.in/)

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/anirudhssundar/anirudhssundar.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
